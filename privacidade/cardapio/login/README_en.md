We need to identify you, and we respect your privacy.

## Login to the Digital Menu

You are using the Menur platform to place orders on the digital menu. We need some personal data.

Menur will send your **NAME** to the menu's establishment. This way, they will identify your order.

Your **EMAIL WILL NOT BE** sent to the establishment. It will remain secure on the platform and will be used to identify your orders.

By choosing to log in with Google or Apple, we will access your **NAME** and **EMAIL** to identify you.

Our AI will use your **EMAIL** to present relevant content on the menu and other media.

**NO OTHER PERSONAL DATA** will be accessed by Menur during this procedure.

If you **DO NOT AGREE** with the use of your personal data, place your order directly with the establishment in the traditional way.
