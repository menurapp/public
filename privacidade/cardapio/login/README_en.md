# Privacy

We need to identify you and respect your privacy.

## Login to the Digital Menu

You are using the Menur platform to place orders on the digital menu. We need some personal data.

Menur will send your **NAME** to the menu establishment. Only this way they will identify your order.

Your **EMAIL WILL NOT BE** sent to the establishment. It will remain secure on the platform and will be used to identify your orders.

Opting for Google or Apple login, we will access your **NAME** and **EMAIL** to identify you.

**NO OTHER PERSONAL DATA** will be accessed by Menur during this procedure.

If you **DO NOT AGREE** with the use of your personal data, place your order directly with the establishment in the old-fashioned way.
